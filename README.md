## About

Hi, my name is Nikola Abrahamova and I'm a creative all-round photographer. For me, photography is more than just clicking the trigger. It's the way I can share my view of the world and capture the moments that inspire and move me.


## PORTFOLIO

I'm a photographer who really takes pictures of everything. What I like best is photographs that evoke certain emotions in other people and you have to think about them.

I love to use shadows, they give it more emphasis and emotion.

I take portraits in nature and in the studio.

From family photos I get to pregnancy photos as well as baby photos.

In my spare time, I play in a studio, take pictures of products, or take pictures at music festivals.

### LET'S NOT BE BLIND

A set of photographs that is supported by real stories of people who have suffered domestic violence.

The viewer needs to think a lot about the connection of the accompanying photo. It's never obvious, and that's exactly how it works in daily life.

My grandfather and grandmother have been together for over 55 years. He cheated and punched her several times just because he didn't have anyone else to take out his ego on. Three times she took off and left him, but each time she came back.

My aunt was her husband, and he was humiliating even in the late stages of pregnancy. He got her to the bottom, she had no confidence then. She felt like no one would want her anymore. It wasn't until her child was born and she started defending her child that she got the courage to walk away from him. 


## Bond of friendship

A set of photographs of two young, different ladies who had never seen each other before in their lives.

I wanted to see if I could form a new friendship in one photo shoot. We did things as friends who have known each other for years. We laughed, told stories, ate...

The friendship bond really happened, the ladies are still friends to this day and they are great friends.
